# threading

A Clojure library that provides a small set of threading arrows, the kind of arrows you need on an impulse.

## Usage

```clojure
[threading "0.1.4"]
```

```clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require [threading.core :refer :all]))
```

## [API doc](https://tristefigure.github.io/threading/index.html)

## Showcase

```clojure
(-> the-value
  
    (when-> coll?
      (map-> inc)
      (->> reduce +))

    (if-> (or-> string? (<- *number-accepted?*))
      (-> str keyword))

    (when-not->> (>- (if-> (<- (not *number-accepted?*))
                       (and-> (not-> number?)
                              valid-string?)
                       (or-> valid-string?
                             valid-number?)))
      (println "Not a valid string")
      (append-log :not-a-string)
      (<<- (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Not a string")))))
```

## Arrows

**All of the arrows below come with both a `->` variant and a `->>` variant.**

**All of their arguments are forms in which the threading form will be injected, either at the beginning or the end, depending on which variant is used.**

As such each argument of these threading arrows can be considered as a **threading slot**.

### The anti-threading arrow

As a threading equivalent to `constantly`, and as a way to return a value from a *threading slot* that does not depend on the threaded value, use the `<-` *anti-threading* arrow:

Consider:
```clojure
(-> 123
    (when-not-> (or-> string? (<- *number-accepted?*))
      (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Not a string"))))
```

If you happen to be in the context of a `->>`-like threading arrow, use `<<-` to antithread a value.
```clojure
(when-not-> (or->> (re-matches #"[a-z]+") (<<- *number-accepted?*)
  ...))
```

### Conditionnals

`if->`, `when->`, `if-not->`, `when-not->`

Contrary to their Clojure counterparts (`if`, `when`, etc ...), these threading arrows return the threaded value rather than `nil` when the predicate fails.

Consider:
```clojure
(defn xxx [x]
  (-> x
      (when-> string? (str "_abc"))
      vector))

(xxx "bird")
;; => ["bird_abc"]

(xxx 123)
;; => [123] (rather than [nil])
```

### Boolean operators

`and->`, `or->`

Like their Clojure counterparts, these threading arrows will return early and can be used to control the execution flow just like Clojure's `and` & `or`.

Consider:
```clojure
(and (string? "abc") (vector "abc"))
;; => ["abc"]
(and-> "abc" string? vector)
;; => ["abc"]

(and 123 (string? 123) (println 123))
;; => false
(and-> 123 string? println)
;; => false
```

### Control flow

`tap->` gets is inspiration from Ruby's [`tap`](https://apidock.com/ruby/Object/tap)

> **`tap()`** public
> 
> Yields x to the block, and then returns x. The primary purpose of this
> method is to “tap into” a method chain, in order to perform operations on
> intermediate results within the chain.

In Clojure, this gives:
```clojure
(-> 123
    (tap-> (println "-> the initial value"))
    inc
    (tap->> (println "New value is :")))
;; 123 -> the initial value
;; New value is: 124
;; => 124
```

#### `tap`

The `tap` macro will work in a similar way:
```clojure
(tap (inc 1) (println "Status: done"))
;; Status: done
;; => 2
```

Although it is not a threading arrow strictly speaking it will thread the tapped value into any threading form that happens to be at the first level in its body.

Consider:
```clojure
(tap (inc 1)
     (println "Status: done")
     (->> (println "Result:")))
;; Status: done
;; Result: 2
;; => 2
```

### Debugging

`pp->` and `pp->>` will execute each form, threading them together, and will display at each step a debug line, then return the value from the last expr.
 
```clojure
(pp->> {:a 1 :b 2}
       (merge {:c 3})
       (map (fn [[k n]] [k (inc n)]))
       (into {}))
;; ->>                               : {:a 1, :b 2}
;;     (merge {:c 3})                : {:c 3, :a 1, :b 2}
;;     (map (fn [[k n]] [k (inc n)])): ([:c 4] [:a 2] [:b 3])
;;     (into {})                     : {:c 4, :a 2, :b 3}

;; => {:c 4, :a 2, :b 3}
```

### Fletchings

Used to shift from a thread-first to a thread-last threading-style, or conversely from thread-last to thread-first.

Use `>-` to shift into thread-first mode in the context of a `->>`-like arrow and use `>>-` to shift into thread-last mode in the context of a `->`-like arrow.

#### What's the role of an arrow fletching vs. an arrowhead

An arrow *fletching* defines where the previous threaded form will be injected in the threading form while an arrow *head* defines where the form at hand will be injected in the threading form *threading slots*.

#### Equivalences
```clojure
(->> x (>-  (->  y)))    <=>    (->  x y)    <=>    (->> x (>-> y))
(->> x (>-  (->> y)))    <=>    (->> x y)    <=>    (->> x (>->> y))
(->  x (>>- (->  y)))    <=>    (->  y x)    <=>    (->  x (>>-> y))
(->  x (>>- (->> y)))    <=>    (->> y x)    <=>    (->  x (>>->> y))
```

Example:
```clojure
(->> 100 (>- (->  (/ 10 2))))
;; expands to (-> 100 (/ 10 2))
;; => 5

(->> 10  (>- (->> (/ 100 2))))
;; expands to (->> 10 (/ 100 2))
;; => 5

(-> (/ 10 2) (>>- (->  100)))
;; expands to (-> 100 (/ 10 2))
;; => 5

(-> (/ 100 10) (>>- (->> 2)))
;; expands to (->> 2 (/ 100 10))
;; => 5
```


### More

#### `map->`

```clojure
(map-> [1 2 3] (+ 3))
;; => [4 5 6]
```

## Defining new arrows

The challenge lying in defining both the `->` and `->>` variants, observe the actual definition of `tap`:

```clojure
(defthreading tap
  "Threads the expr through the forms then returns the value of
  the initial expr."
  [-> "Threads like `->`."
   ->> "Threads like `->>`."]
  [expr & forms]
  `(let [result# ~expr]
     (~&threading-variant result# ~@forms) ;; &threading-variant is bound
     result#))                             ;; to '-> then '->>
```

## Why use `threading` ?

#### Readability

Compare:
```clojure
(let [selection (fetch resource opts)]
  (if (<= (count selection) 1)
    (first selection)
    selection)))
```

vs:
```clojure
(-> (fetch resource opts)
    (if-> (->> count (<= 1)) first))
```

## TODO

-  `cond->`, maybe `merge->`, etc... Contributions are welcome if they are driven by *an impluse*.
-  `pp->` is a bit weird at times.
